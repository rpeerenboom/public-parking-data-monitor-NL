"""
Sends a request to every static data link in the index file and stores the
result in a folder, in a file named after the UUID of the facility. It allows
to cache locally the static data, in order not to send requests every time.
It uses a small JSON file to keep track of which files have been cached so far,
which will be created if it does not exist.

Example:
    python cache.py cache-dir/ cache_list.json data_index_1_3_fixed.json
